# Latin Square Solver
This project was done as a final assessment for a unit (Topics in Information Science II: Efficient Search Methods in
Artificial Intelligence) I took on exchange at The University of Tokyo.

It uses techniques such as stochastic hill climbing (local search) to solve the combinatorial latin square problem efficiently.
`latin_square_v2.py` scales significantly better than `latin_square_v1.py`.
